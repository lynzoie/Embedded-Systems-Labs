2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net foursDigit_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin foursDigit_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell foursDigit_reg[0]/L3_2 (in foursDigit_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net onesDigit_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin onesDigit_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell onesDigit_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net threesDigit_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin threesDigit_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell threesDigit_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net threesDigit_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin threesDigit_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell threesDigit_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net threesDigit_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin threesDigit_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell threesDigit_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net threesDigit_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin threesDigit_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell threesDigit_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
